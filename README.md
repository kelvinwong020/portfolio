## Projects (Detailed Project Portfolio May Be Found Within Repositories)
### <a name="EMG"></a>EMG Fitness Device - HKUST Final Year Project
[Android Application](https://github.com/kelvinwong020/FYP_EMG_Android)
| [Arduino Code](https://github.com/whiteunicorn3404/JQ03a-21_EMG_FYP)
| [Demo](https://youtu.be/pZxpOF_Pch0)

This project aims to build a portable and affordable personal muscle monitoring system, consisting of a wearable device containing EMG(Electromyography) sensors to track muscle signals and a mobile application (Android) to assist users in preventing muscle injuries during workouts or in daily life. The wearable device transmits real-time EMG data to the mobile application for signal analysis. When a drop in the median frequency in EMG is detected, the application will prompt the user to cease further activity to prevent injury. A TensorFlow model was included to classify the actions being taken by the user.

The technology used for this project are: <b>Java, Android, BLE, C++, Arduino, TensorFlow</b>.

### Smart Home System - HKUST ELEC 3300 Project
[Repository](https://github.com/kelvinwong020/Smart-Home-System)
| [Demo](https://youtu.be/idSp3R__D4U)

In this project, we built an IOT(Internet Of Things) system that utilizes STM32F103 development boards to control an array of sensors and devices. This systems contains 4 major components: room monitoring, automatic brightness control, automatic temperature control, and control over WLAN. The project aims to provide a suite of centralized electronic devices that can improve the quality of life within a household. Originally, the system was intended to have a door lock control system and a mobile application for remote control. But due to budget and time constraints, these components was reduced to room monitoring and web server instead.

The technology used for this project are: <b>C, I2C, UART, SPI, GPIO, STLink, STM32</b>.
